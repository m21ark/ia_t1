# AI Project 1: Labyrinth Search

## Overview

This project is an implementation of search algorithms for a labyrinth game. The game is implemented using the `pygame` library.

The code was developed in Python 3.10.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented:

* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Greedy Search
* Iterative Deepening Search
* A* Search
* Weighted A* Search
* Genetic Algorithm

## Heuristics

The following heuristics are implemented:

* Manhattan Distance
* Chebyshev Distance
* Euclidean Distance

## Code Structure

The code's arquitecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
The code is structured as follows:

* `/algorithms/`: The search algorithms
* `/assets/`: The assets used in the program
* `/controller/`: The controller classes
* `/menu/`: The menu classes
* `/model/`: The model classes
* `/view/`: The view classes

## Running the Code

The code can be run from the command line using the following command:

```pyhton
python3 main.py [--statistics]
```

### Dependencies

The dependencies needed to run the code are present in the `requirements.txt` file. They can be installed using the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Statistics

The `--statistics` flag can be used to print statistics about the search. The statistics are outputed to a `results.xlsx` file.

## Output

The output of the program is the game itself. The visualization is done using the `pygame` and `pygame_menu` libraries.
